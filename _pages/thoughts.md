I am a great fan of cooking and have mastered several dishes including twice-cooked pork, French-style cream stewed chicken, Red-braised pork, and Sweet and sour pork. Although I mentioned a lot of pork, the ingredients I like the most are actually mushrooms and chicken! No matter how to cook them. the result would be good. Let's enjoy some delicious pics!

Besides cooking, I love reading books. Not novels, but thoughts. People say reading books is like talking with past sages, and I talk to those who want to talk to me directly. I have dabbled in history, philosophy, law, and military. I am particularly interested in Eastern philosophy. One interesting question that sends me thinking comes from a preface. A question was raised in the introduction of *A Short History of Chinese Philosophy*: is this a history book of Chinese Philosophy? or is it a book of philosophical history in China? All attempts to answer it come down to a true or false question: Is there philosophy in China? It is very interesting to think about this, and what's more interesting to think about is: Is Philosophy the only kind of philosophy?

  <summary>Some Reflections on Tao</summary>
Tao strongly influenced me, in particular stepping away from Thoughts. It is not about giving up self-motivation in any sense, it is about following the natural flow and rhythm of the universe. People love stuff, but that can't go to the extreme, and people hate stuff, and that will vanish within. People want unbounded resources and want things done immediately. I want infinite resources, I want achievements immediately. And I want no failure. But these will not happen. Not only that, but it will be painful. The more thinking, the more agony. It is the flanking of greed and despair belonging to only the individual. But that's not irresolvable. Open the eyes, and empty the mind. Look outside, look around, look at the nature. Aren't the trees wanting to grow bigger, stronger, and taller? But they know these will not happen tomorrow. Aren't buddings want to grow into leaves, flowers, and fruits and shine under the sun? But nature has its time.

When Spring comes, do Spring stuff;\
When Summer comes, do Summer stuff;\
When Fall comes, do Fall stuff;\
When Winter comes, do Winter stuff;\
Things will get done, and what's wanted will be achieved. The world is sometimes as simple as this: time will give people everything they want.
