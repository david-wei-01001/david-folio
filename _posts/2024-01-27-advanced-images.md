This will record my book excerpts

## Introduction

This blog records all the sentences I encountered compelling, powerful, knowledgable, thought-provoking, or led to meditation while I reading books. These are treasuries for you and for me. Let's take a cup of coffee, sit down, clear our minds, and enjoy reading.

Most of the books I read are Chinese, so be prepared for a new language。

## The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America

- "In a contest of reason, if your opponent has been taught that thinking is a mere waste of energy, what could give you a greater advantage?"

- "Some people hastily sell their shares in a company when it performs slightly well to realize profits, yet they stubbornly hold on to those that perform poorly. Peter Lynch aptly compared this behavior to 'cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.'"

- "A person with mediocre vision does not need to search for a needle in a haystack."

- "When dumb money acknowledges its limitations, it is no longer dumb."

- "The stock market is a place of continual realignment, where money flows from the active to the patient."

- "We do not think that success in long-term investment can be achieved by flitting from one flower to another. It is as ridiculous to call those who trade frequently 'investors' as it is to call those who favor one-night stands 'romantics'."
