## An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations

- It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.

- It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.

- He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and shrew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them

- It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest

- The effect of those different geniuses and talants, for the want of power or disposition to truck, barter or exchange,cannot be brought into a common stock, and do not in the least contribute to the better accommodation and conveniency of the species

- The extent of their market, therefore, must for a long time be in proportion to the riches and populousness of that country, and consequently their improvement must always be posterior to the improvement of that country

- In all countries, however, men seem at least to have been determined by irresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to metals above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as little loss as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable that they are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number of parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be re-united again; a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess, and which more than any other quality renders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and circulation.

- I believe, the avarice and injustice of princes and sovereign states, abusing the confidence of their subjects, have by degrees diminished the real quantity of metal, which had been originally contained in their coins

- The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.

- The power which that possession (fortune) immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of purchasing; a certain command over all the labour, or over all the produce of labour which is then in the market

- Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price only

- As it is the nominal or money price of goods,therefore, which finally determines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and sales, and thereby regulates almost the whole business of common life in which price is concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more attended to than the real price.

## The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Investors and Managers

- "In a competition of reason, if your opponent is taught that thinking is purely a waste of energy, what could give you a greater advantage?"

- "Some people rush to sell shares of companies that perform slightly well to realize profits, yet they stubbornly hold onto those that perform poorly. Peter Lynch aptly compared this behavior to 'cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.'"

- "A person with average vision doesn't need to look for a needle in a haystack."

- "When dumb money acknowledges its limitations, it is no longer dumb."

- "The stock market is a place that constantly repositions itself, where money flows from the active to the patient."

- "We don't believe it's possible to achieve long-term investment success by merely hopping from one flower to another, especially under market pressure, whether due to financial or psychological stress. Calling those who frequently trade 'investors' is as absurd as calling those who prefer one-night stands 'romantics.'"

- "Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket closely."

- "Price is what you pay, value is what you get."

- "The costs of frequent trading activities can harm long-term investments."

- "Splits increase trading costs as they double the turnover rate; they attract short-term traders who focus excessively on short-term market fluctuations; and for these reasons, splits can cause stock prices to deviate significantly from the intrinsic value of the company."

- "Exceptional scarce companies have two qualities: they possess excellent economic characteristics, i.e., moats, and their executives have outstanding management skills, capable of realizing the potential of poorly operated companies and achieving feats ordinary people cannot."

- "The market is ideal for any investor, no matter the size, as long as they stick to their investment system. Market fluctuations caused by fund managers with vast assets actually provide real investors with more prudent investment opportunities."

- "Only under tough market conditions, when investors are forced to sell due to financial or psychological stress, are they harmed by market fluctuations."

- "Our goal is to discover outstanding companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at cheap prices."

- "There's really no difference between buying controlling shares of a company or purchasing publicly traded shares on the market."

- "In calculating value, growth is actually a component of value."

- "Consciously paying a high price for a stock, hoping to sell it quickly at an even higher price, should be labeled as speculation."

- "Growth is beneficial to investors only if every dollar funding the growth creates more than one dollar of market value in the long run."

- "The most valuable companies are those that can consistently utilize incremental capital to achieve high returns over an extended period; conversely, the worst companies are those that need or will require continuous large capital inputs but offer low returns."

- "For most people in investing, it's not important what they know; what's more important is that they know what they don't know."

- "A smart stock investor will do better in the secondary stock market than by participating in IPOs."

- "No matter the genius or effort, some things take time. Even if you can make nine women pregnant at the same time, you can't make them deliver a baby in one month."

- "Being unmoved like a mountain makes us like a sage, who does not frantically sell off profitable companies due to slight anticipated changes in the Federal Reserve's interest rates or changes in the opinions of some Wall Street experts."

- "Students learning about investing only need to master two lessons: how to assess the value of a company and how to deal with market prices."

- "As an investor, your goal is simple: to purchase at a rational price a business that is easy to understand, whose earnings are expected to grow significantly from today to the next five, ten, or twenty years. Over time, you will find that not many companies meet these criteria, so when you do find one that does, you should buy in significantly, not just dabble for fun."
  
- "If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes."

- "Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies."

- "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

- "Fools will give you reasons; the wise never will."

- "We don't get penalized for not swinging at bad pitches, but standing at the plate with the bat on our shoulders day after day isn't a pleasant situation either."

- "Unless you're a professional liquidator, the 'cigarette butt' strategy is foolish."

- "If there's one cockroach in the kitchen, there are likely more."

- "Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre."

- "A good jockey will perform well only on a good horse; on a poor horse, they will accomplish nothing."

- "Take it slow, no rush."

- "We still haven’t learned how to solve the problems of troubled businesses; what we have learned is to avoid them."

- "Great investment opportunities occur when a superb company encounters a one-time solvable problem."

- "We prefer to sidestep monsters rather than slay them."

- "No matter how long a string of numbers you have, if you multiply it by zero, the result will always be zero."

- "The success of Las Vegas is built on the transfer of wealth, a transfer fueled by people's eagerness to partake in games of capital transfer that seem small but are disadvantageous."

- "Imagine a 25-year-old MBA student considering merging his future economic interests with those of a 25-year-old day laborer; the MBA student would find that merging his equity with the laborer's on a stock-for-stock basis would greatly enhance his short-term gains, but what deal could be more foolish?"

- "Go to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been."

- "One day, a man went to the veterinarian and said, 'Can you help me? Sometimes my horse walks fine, and other times it limps.' The vet's response was straightforward: 'No problem, sell him when he walks fine.'"

- "Sellers have far more knowledge about the company than buyers, and they choose the timing of the sale."

- "If your actions are reasonable, you are bound to get good results; in most cases, leverage merely accelerates the motion of things."

- "Leverage is addictive; once you miraculously profit from it, few people are willing to return to their previous conservative state."

- "Cash and credit are like oxygen; when abundant, people don't notice their presence, but their importance is realized only when they are gone."

- "Gold has two major drawbacks: it's not very useful, and it can't reproduce itself."

- "When we hear everyone saying 'cash is king', that is exactly the time to deploy cash, not hold it; when everyone says cash is trash, that is the era when fixed-income products are the most attractive we can remember."

- "The ideal investment asset should be one that continues to provide an output that preserves its purchasing power during inflation with very little need for new capital investment."

- "Falling stock prices benefit us, rising stock prices harm us."

- "We like doing business in a pessimistic environment, not because we like pessimism, but because we like the prices it brings. For a rational buyer, optimism is the enemy."

- "Of course, this doesn't mean that merely because a business or stock is unpopular, buying them is the right action. Such an idea is also a foolish following of the crowd. What is required here is independent thought, not echoing others."

- "Most people would rather die than think."

- "The business world is full of pitfalls, and a business plan that demands avoiding all pitfalls is itself a disaster."

- "The wise initiate, the foolish conclude."

- "The payment method of zero-coupon bonds establishes this principle: if you solemnly promise not to pay a penny for a long time, then you will not default for a long time."

- "Even a high school dropout knows that if you borrow money to buy a car, your income must not only cover the interest on the loan and the running costs of the car, but also the true depreciation calculated. If he talks about EBITDA when borrowing from the bank, he would flee amid derision."

- "When issuing bonds, investment bankers show their humorous side by presenting financial data, income statements, and balance sheets for the next five years or more for companies they had only heard about a few months ago."

- "(On misappropriated funds) Before being discovered, the person who misappropriates the funds becomes rich by embezzlement, and the person from whom the funds are misappropriated does not feel poor. This stolen wealth should be added to the national wealth so that we understand the mental wealth of the nation."

- "(Sarcastically) Logically, a society that needs to feel huge prosperity should encourage its citizens to misappropriate funds and also strive to avoid being discovered. In this way, even without productive work, wealth will inflate."

- "Foolish prices always attract sellers."

- "Trading is the lifeblood of finance."

- "Mistakes often happen at the time of decision."

- "Bankruptcy courts have become the sanatoriums of airlines."

- "The mistakes made in derivatives are asymmetrical. They almost always favor traders eyeing millions in bonuses, or CEOs hoping to report eye-catching profits, or both."

- "History tells us that a crisis that causes problems is often triggered during a calm period by a series of unexpected events."

- "When Munger and I read the lengthy disclosures of major banks' derivatives, the only thing we can understand is that we really don't know how much risk these institutions are taking on."

- "When a problem occurs, whether in personal life or business, the best time to act is immediately."

- "I liked you more before I knew you."

- "The graveyard of prophets is filled mostly with macro analysts."

- "Stock buybacks should meet two conditions: first, a company must have ample cash for operations and liquidity needs; second, the stock price must be far below a conservatively estimated intrinsic value."

- "It's not just about saying that buybacks are to offset the dilutive impact of stock issuance, or just because a company has surplus cash, that we should buy back shares. Unless the buyback price is below intrinsic value, those shareholders who remain will be harmed."

- "The first rule of capital allocation often is that you may be smart at one price but foolish at another."

- "Those who buy for non-value reasons will also sell for non-value reasons."

- "Brokers sing praises for companies with huge turnover; they can't fill your pockets, but they can fill your ears."

- "What's beneficial for the casino manager may not necessarily benefit the clients."

- "An overly active stock market is a pickpocket to businesses."

- "Adam Smith believed that in a free market, various non-collusive actions are guided by an invisible hand towards the optimization of economic progress; our view is that in a casino-like market, impatient investment managers play an invisible foot, constantly tripping up the forward-moving economy, slowing down economic development."

- "Noah's rule: The important thing is to build the ark, not to predict the rain."

- "You shouldn't use gold valued as lead to buy gold valued as gold."

- "Don't ask a barber if you need a haircut."

- "Warfare is a matter of vital importance to the state; it is a matter of life and death, a road either to survival or to ruin. Hence, it is imperative that it be thoroughly studied."

- "The five elements: moral influence, weather, terrain, command, and doctrine."

- "The seven considerations: Who has the moral influence? Who has the ability? Who has the advantage of heaven and earth? Whose discipline is effective? Whose troops are stronger? Whose officers and men are more trained? Who administers rewards and punishments more clearly? From these, I can predict success or failure."

- "The general must possess wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, and strictness."

- "Momentum is manipulating the force of the situation to your advantage."

- "Warfare is the way of deception."

- "Appear where you are not expected; show weakness when you are strong, and strength when you are weak."

- "Entice the enemy with bait, strike chaos, prepare against him where he is unprepared, avoid him where he is strong, irritate him, humble him, exhaust him, disunite him."

- "Attack where he is unprepared, come at him when he does not expect it."

- "Those who win without fighting are calculated in advance; their victories are not due to chance."

- "In employing troops, when you utilize the enemy's provisions, every bushel of food taken from the enemy is equivalent to twenty you can use."

- "When using forces, the expense of maintaining vehicles and provisions across a thousand li and feeding hundreds of thousands can be costly. Hence, swift victory is important."

- "Long-lasting warfare has never benefited any country."

- "Therefore, those who do not know the harms of using troops cannot fully understand the benefits of using them."

- "The best policy is to capture the state intact; it should be destroyed only if no other options are available."

- "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."

- "Military tactics involve calculations that can be compared to the crossing of a river; do not move until all the advantages are in your favor."

- "In battle, engage the enemy in a way that conforms to the situation. If ten times the enemy's strength, surround them; if five times, attack them; if double, divide them; if equal, be able to fight them; if fewer, be able to evade them; if weaker, be able to avoid them."

- "The ultimate skill in war is not to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles but to subdue the enemy without fighting."

- "One who knows when he can and cannot fight will be victorious; one who uses his men wisely will maintain morale; one who shares the same spirit throughout his ranks will stand strong; one who is prepared and waits for the unprepared will be secure; one who is capable but appears incapable will gain the advantage."

- "Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are certain to be in peril."

- "Those skilled in defense hide in the deepest depths of the earth; those skilled in attack move in the highest reaches of the heavens."

- "If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself."

- "Lifting a feather is not a sign of great strength; seeing the sun and moon is not a sign of sharp sight; hearing the noise of thunder is not a sign of a keen ear."

- "Those skilled in war bring the enemy to the field of battle and are not brought there by him. They win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."

- "The victorious army is like weighing a gram against a kilogram; the defeated army is like weighing a kilogram against a gram."

- "In warfare, engage with a standard formation, win with an unexpected strategy."

- "Those who excel at employing the unexpected are as limitless as heaven and earth, as inexhaustible as the rivers and seas."

- "The force of water is such that it can sweep away stones; such is momentum. The speed of an attacking raptor is such that it can break its prey; such is timing."

- "The wise warrior seeks the battle through the momentum of the situation, not demanding perfection from individuals, thus he can select the capable and position them where they can succeed."

- "Those who arrive first on the battlefield rest and wait for the enemy; those arriving late are exhausted by the rush to battle."

- "The skilled warrior drives others; he is not driven by them."

- "Appear where the enemy does not expect, and attack where they are unprepared."

- "Subtlety upon subtlety, until you are formless; mystery upon mystery, until you are silent."

- "When I wish to fight, even though the enemy has high walls and deep moats, they cannot help but fight if I attack where they must come to their rescue; when I do not wish to fight, I draw a line on the ground and the enemy will not dare to engage, creating a division."

- "If I am formless, then the enemy cannot know me. If I am unknown, then the enemy must respond to many threats."

- "The few must prepare for the many; the many make the few prepare for themselves."

- "Plan and calculate to know the outcome of victory or defeat, manage to know dynamics of action, and position to know the grounds of life and death."

- "The ultimate in disposing of one's troops lies in their formation being without formation; being formless, spies cannot spy, wise enemies cannot plan against it."

- "All may know the tactics whereby I conquer, but none can see the strategy out of which victory is evolved."

- "Just as flowing water avoids the heights and hastens to the lowlands, so an army avoids strength and strikes weakness."

- "As water shapes its flow in accordance with the ground, so an army manages its victory according to the situation of the enemy."

- "Water has no constant shape, there are no constant conditions in war. Those who can adapt and change in accord with the enemy and achieve victory are divine."

- "The Five Elements do not always overcome each other, the Four Seasons do not have a constant position, the sun has its periods of short and long, the moon has its periods of waxing and waning."

- "Raising an army to fight for profit will fail; deploying an army to compete for profit will lose its support."

- "An army without its baggage train is lost; without provisions, it is lost; without bases of supply, it is lost."

- "War is based on deception, moves as an advantage emerges, changes through dividing and reuniting."

- "Its rapidity is like the wind, its slowness like the forest; it invades like fire, it is immovable like a mountain. It is hard to know like the dark, it strikes like thunder."

- "(Li Jing) Rewards and punishments must be substantial and not deceitful, execution must be strict and not waived."

- "(Duke of Zhou) The speed of thunder does not allow time to cover the ears, the flash of lightning does not allow time to blink."

- "When focused, the brave cannot advance alone, the cowardly cannot retreat alone; this is the method of employing the masses."

- "The morale of an army can be broken, and the heart of a general can be seized."

- "Face chaos with order, face noise with quiet. Avoid its cutting edge, attack its laxity."

- "(Military Affairs) Advance when advantageous, retreat when difficulties arise. Avoid the strong."

- "Thus, the principles of warfare are: do not scale high ridges, do not fight with your back to a hill, do not follow the enemy when he feigns flight, do not attack soldiers whose spirit is keen, do not swallow bait offered by the enemy, do not obstruct a retreating army, leave an outlet free in a surrounded army, and do not press an enemy at bay."

- "(The Three Strategies) Beneath the lure, there must be hidden hooks."

- "There are paths not to be followed, armies not to be struck, cities not to be besieged, grounds not to be contested, and orders from the sovereign not to be obeyed."

- (Zhang Yu) "Let it go without any loss, conquer it without any gain."

- "If you are prepared everywhere, you will be weak everywhere."

- "Therefore, the concerns of the wise are mixed with benefits and harms. Mixed with benefits, actions must be trustworthy; mixed with harms, troubles must be solvable."

- (Cao Cao) "Think of harm when in a beneficial situation, and think of benefit when in a harmful situation."

- (From "Strategies of Wu") "A gentleman should always be prepared for peace times, never parting from his sword."

- "Thus, the principles of military operations are: do not rely on the enemy not coming, but rely on our readiness to receive him; do not rely on the enemy not attacking, but rely on our position being unassailable."

- (Zhao Benxue) "Though years and months may pass, it is no different from when first assembled; though through nights of pouring rain and harsh frost, there is no break as in moments when the wind is high and horses neigh. With a heart that travels ten thousand miles, vigilance does not stray from just before one's eyes."

- "A general has five dangers: if determined to die, he can be killed; if determined to live, he can be captured; if quick to anger, he can be provoked; if overly upright, he can be shamed; if compassionate, he can be harassed. An army can be defeated and its general killed if these five dangers are present."

- (Huang Shi Gong) "The brave like to follow their will; the foolish do not care about their death."

- (Zhuge Liang) "In mountain warfare, do not ascend to the heights; in naval combat, do not go against the current; in battle on grasslands, do not enter deep grass; in open field warfare, do not counteract when the enemy is formless."

- "If the enemy is quiet while close, it relies on its fortifications; if it challenges from afar, it wishes for you to advance; if its position is easily accessible, it is advantageous; if multiple trees are moving, it is approaching; if the grass moves a lot, it is suspicious; if birds startle, there is an ambush; if animals are frightened, there is an ambush; if dust rises sharply, it is the chariots coming; if the dust is low and spread wide, it is the infantry; if it disperses and is orderly, it is gathering wood; if few and moving back and forth, it is encamping; if humble in words but increasingly prepared, it is advancing; if strong in words but advancing forcefully, it is retreating; if light vehicles move out first and station on the sides, it is forming up; if without reason asking for peace, it is planning; if rushing and forming up, it is about to engage; if half advancing and half retreating, it is luring."

- "Those who are carefree and underestimate the enemy will surely be captured by others."

- (From "Wei Liaozi - Military Orders") "I have heard that ancient good commanders could kill half of the enemy's soldiers, next best would kill a third, and the least would kill a tenth. Those who could kill half would command awe within the empire; those killing a third would exert power over feudal lords; those killing a tenth would have their orders followed by the soldiers."

- (From "Zuo Zhuan - Year 31 of Duke Xiang") "Moreover, he is not yet fifty but behaves as if he is in his eighties or nineties, he will not last long."

- (From "Zuo Zhuan - Year 22 of Duke Xi") "A state, no matter how small, should not be underestimated."

- "Terrain is an aid to the army."

- "Estimating the enemy to achieve victory, considering the perils of distance and proximity, is the way of the superior general."

- "If the way of battle is certain of victory, the ruler says there is no battle, yet battle can occur; if the way of battle is not certain of victory, the ruler says to battle, yet no battle can occur."

- "Advance not seeking fame, retreat not avoiding blame, the foremost concern is the safety of the people, and benefits align with the ruler, the treasure of the state."

- "Regard your troops as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death."

- (From "Zuo Zhuan") "Authority subdues their beloved, though few, they must succeed; love added to authority, though many, must fail."

- "Knowing my troops can strike but not knowing the enemy cannot be struck, half the victory is achieved; knowing the enemy can be struck but not knowing my troops cannot strike, half the victory is achieved; knowing the enemy can be struck, knowing my troops can strike, but not knowing the terrain is not conducive to battle, half the victory is achieved. Thus, those who know warfare move without confusion and act without exhaustion. Therefore, it is said: knowing oneself and the enemy, victories are not endangered; knowing heaven and earth, victories are inexhaustible."

- "Sun Tzu said: In the use of troops, there are nine kinds of situations: Dispersive ground, light ground, contentious ground, open ground, intersecting highways, serious ground, difficult ground, encircled ground, and death ground."

- "On dispersive ground, do not fight; on light ground, do not stop; on contentious ground, do not attack; on open ground, do not cut off; on intersecting highways, join forces; on serious ground, plunder; on difficult ground, keep going; on encircled ground, plan; on death ground, fight."

- "Land without springs, pasture, or wood gathering is cut off. On cut-off ground, do not linger."

- "Those who are cornered without strategy are impoverished; impoverished and not battling are annihilated."

- "The so-called ancient good use of troops enabled making the enemy's reinforcements unable to meet, neither relying on their numbers nor their elites to come to aid."

- "The essence of military operations is speed."

- "Foraging in rich fields, the army has sufficient food."

- "Soldiers in deep formation are fearless, with nowhere else to go they must fight; when deeply engaged, they are restricted; when without choice, they battle."

- "Being impulsive is like the snake of Mount Chang: strike its head, and its tail arrives; strike its tail, and its head arrives; strike at the center, and both head and tail arrive."

- "Blind the soldiers’ eyes and ears to make them ignorant; change their tasks and alter their plans so they are unrecognizable; change their quarters and confuse their paths so they cannot anticipate."

- "Therefore, not knowing the plans of the princes cannot prepare alliances; not knowing the mountains, forests, dangerous defiles, and marshes cannot conduct a march; not employing local guides cannot take advantage of the terrain."

- "Implement rewards without fixed standards, enact commands without governance, facing the mass of the three armies as if directing one person."

- "Thrust them into desperate ground, then they will survive; trap them in deadly ground, then they will live."

- "Begin timidly like a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterward move swiftly like a escaping rabbit, so the enemy cannot resist."

- "Fires must have a source, smoke and fire must be prepared in advance. The ignition of a fire has its timing, the starting of a fire has its day."

- "Day winds last long, night winds stop."

- "Using fire to support an attack is wise, using water to support an attack is strong. Water can cut off, but it cannot rob."

- "If one fights and conquers but does not manage his achievements, it is disastrous; this is called 'costly delay.'"

- "A ruler should not start an army in anger, a general should not engage in battle out of spite."

- "Act when it is beneficial, stop when it is not."

- "Anger can turn to joy, irritation can be replaced with delight, a ruined state cannot be restored, the dead cannot be brought back to life."

- "Therefore, wise rulers and capable generals win before they move and their successes exceed those of the multitude, through foreknowledge."

- "Of all military pursuits, none is more intimate than espionage; no rewards are more richly deserved than those for espionage, no affairs are more confidential than those of espionage. Without saintly wisdom, you cannot use espionage; without righteousness, you cannot employ espionage; without subtlety, you cannot get the truth of espionage."

- "When Yin rose, Yi Zhi was in Xia; when Zhou rose, Lü Ya was in Yin."
