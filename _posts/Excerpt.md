This will record my book excerpts

## Introduction

This blog records all the sentences I encountered compelling, powerful, knowledgable, thought-provoking, or led to meditation while I reading books. These are treasuries for you and me. Let's take a cup of coffee, sit down, clear our minds, and enjoy reading.

This excerpt will be a growing list, featuring the growing list of books I read.
Most of the books I read are Chinese, so be prepared for a new language。

## The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America

- "In a contest of reason, if your opponent has been taught that thinking is a mere waste of energy, what could give you a greater advantage?"

- "Some people hastily sell their shares in a company when it performs slightly well to realize profits, yet they stubbornly hold on to those that perform poorly. Peter Lynch aptly compared this behavior to 'cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.'"

- "A person with mediocre vision does not need to search for a needle in a haystack."

- "When dumb money acknowledges its limitations, it is no longer dumb."

- "The stock market is a place of continual realignment, where money flows from the active to the patient."

- "We do not think that success in long-term investment can be achieved by flitting from one flower to another. It is as ridiculous to call those who trade frequently 'investors' as it is to call those who favor one-night stands 'romantics'."

## 商君书

- 愚者暗于成事，知者见于未萌
  
- 民不可与虑始，而可与乐成
  
- 论至德者不和于俗，成大功者不谋于众
  
- 治世不一道，便国不必法古
  
- 民不贵学则愚，愚则无外交，无外交，则国安而不殆
  
- 愚民不知，不好学问，则务疾农
  
- 重关市之赋，则农恶商，商有疑堕之心

- 凡人主之所以劝民者，官爵也。国之所以兴者，农战也

- 国力抟者强，国好言谈者削

- 农战之民千人，而有《诗》、《书》辩惠者一人焉，千人者皆怠于农战矣。
  农战之民百人，而有技艺者一人焉，百人者皆怠于农战矣。

- 国待农战而安，主待农战而尊。

- 归心于农，则民朴而可正也，纯纯则易使也。

- 夫民之亲上而死制也，以其旦暮从事于农。

- 国作壹一岁者，十岁强；作壹十岁者，百岁强；作壹百岁者，千岁强；千岁强者王。
