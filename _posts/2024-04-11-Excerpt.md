This will record my book excerpts

## Introduction

This blog records all the sentences I encountered compelling, powerful, knowledgable, thought-provoking, or led to meditation while I reading books. These are treasuries for you and me. Let's take a cup of coffee, sit down, clear our minds, and enjoy reading.

This excerpt will be a growing list, featuring the growing list of books I read.
Most of the books I read are Chinese, so be prepared for a new language。

## The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America

- "In a contest of reason, if your opponent has been taught that thinking is a mere waste of energy, what could give you a greater advantage?"

- "Some people hastily sell their shares in a company when it performs slightly well to realize profits, yet they stubbornly hold on to those that perform poorly. Peter Lynch aptly compared this behavior to 'cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.'"

- "A person with mediocre vision does not need to search for a needle in a haystack."

- "When dumb money acknowledges its limitations, it is no longer dumb."

- "The stock market is a place of continual realignment, where money flows from the active to the patient."

- "We do not think that success in long-term investment can be achieved by flitting from one flower to another. It is as ridiculous to call those who trade frequently 'investors' as it is to call those who favor one-night stands 'romantics'."

- "Put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket closely."

- "Price is what you pay, value is what you get."

- "The costs of frequent trading undermine long-term investment."

- "First, splitting increases transaction costs because it doubles the turnover rate; second, splitting attracts short-term traders who overly focus on short-term market fluctuations; third, due to the above reasons, splitting leads to severe deviations of stock prices from the intrinsic value of the company."

- "Outstanding and scarce companies have two qualities: first, they possess excellent economic characteristics, that is, they have moats; second, their executives have exceptional management skills, adept at uncovering potential in poorly operated companies and accomplishing feats that are difficult for ordinary people."

- The market is ideal for any investor. Regardless of size, as long as he adheres to his own investment system, the market fluctuations caused by those managers holding huge funds actually provide wise investment opportunities for the true investor.

- Only during tough market times, when investors are forced to sell due to financial or psychological pressure, are they harmed by stock market fluctuations.

- Our goal is to find outstanding companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at cheap prices.

- Whether buying controlling stakes in companies or buying shares of publicly traded companies that are available on the market, we really don't see any difference.

- In calculating value, growth is actually a component of value.

- Consciously paying a high price for a stock and then hoping to sell it quickly at a higher price should be labeled as speculation.

- Growth is beneficial to investors only when each dollar invested in fostering growth can create more than one dollar of market value in the long term.

- The most worthwhile companies are those that can continuously utilize incremental capital to achieve high returns over an extended period, whereas the worst companies are those that must or will require continuous large capital investments but yield low returns.

- For most people in investing, what they know is not important; what is more important is knowing what they do not know.

- A smart stock investor will do better in the secondary market than in participating in IPOs.

- No matter the genius or effort, some things always take time. Even if you can make nine women pregnant at the same time, they can't give birth in one month.

- Being steadfast makes us like a sage, not frenetically selling profitable companies due to slight anticipated changes in Federal Reserve rates or changes in some experts' views on Wall Street.

- Students learning about investing only need to excel in two courses: how to evaluate a company's value and how to treat market prices.

- As an investor, your goal is simple: to rationally purchase an easily understandable company whose profits from today to the next five, ten, and twenty years are expected to grow substantially. Over time, you will find that not many companies meet this standard, so when you find one that does, you should buy in significantly, not just dabble for fun.

- If you aren't planning to hold a stock for ten years, then don't even consider holding it for ten minutes.

- Investors should remember that excitement and cost are their enemies.

- Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

- "Only a fool gives you reasons, a wise person never does."

- "We don't get penalized for swinging at three bad pitches, but just standing there day after day with the bat on your shoulder isn't very enjoyable either."

- "Unless you are a professional liquidator, a cigarette butt strategy is just foolish."

- "If there is one cockroach in the kitchen, there can't just be one."

- "Time is a friend of a great company and an enemy of a mediocre one."

- "A good rider only performs well on a good horse; on a bad horse, they achieve nothing."

- "Take it slow, no rush."

- "We still haven't learned how to fix problematic businesses; what we've learned is to avoid them."

- "Great investment opportunities often occur when a great company encounters a one-time solvable problem."

- "We tend to avoid the monster, not kill it."

- "No matter how long a string of numbers is, if you multiply it by zero, the result will definitely be zero."

- "If your actions are reasonable, you will surely get good results; in most cases, leverage only accelerates the movement of events."

- "Leverage is addictive; once you miraculously profit, few people are willing to return to their former conservative state."

- "Cash and credit are like oxygen; people don’t notice their presence until they are gone, and then their importance is realized."

- "Gold has two major flaws: it isn't very useful and it cannot reproduce itself."

- "When everyone says 'cash is king', that's exactly when you should be using cash rather than holding it; when everyone says cash is trash, that’s when fixed income products are at their most attractive in our memory."

- "The most ideal investment assets are those that still provide outputs that maintain their purchasing power during inflation periods with very little new capital investment."

- "Stock price declines are beneficial for us, while increases are detrimental."

- "We like to do business in pessimistic environments, not because we like pessimism, but because we like the prices it brings. For a rational buyer, optimism is the enemy."

- "Of course, this doesn’t mean that merely because a company or stock is unpopular it's right to buy them. This idea is also a foolish strategy of following the herd. What is required here is independent thinking, not echoing others."

- "Most people would rather die than think."

- "The commercial world is full of pitfalls; a business plan that insists on avoiding all pitfalls is itself a disaster."

- "The wise initiate, fools conclude."

- "Zero-coupon bonds’ method of interest payment establishes this principle: if you solemnly promise not to pay a penny for a long time, then you won't default for a long time."

- 兵者，国之大事，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也

- 五事：道、天、地、将、法

- 七计：主孰有道？将孰有能？天地孰得？法令孰行？兵众孰强？士卒孰练？赏罚孰明？吾以此知胜负矣

- 将者，智、信、仁、勇、严也

- 势者，因利而制权也

- 兵者，诡道也

- 能而示之不能，用而示之不用，近而示之远，远而示之近

- 利而诱之，乱而取之，实而备之，强而避之，怒而挠之，卑而骄之，佚而劳之，亲而离之

- 攻其无备，出其不意

- 夫未战而庙算胜者，得算多也；未战而庙算不胜者，得算少也

- 凡用兵之法，驰车千驷，革车千乘，带甲十万，千里馈粮。则内外之费，宾客之用，胶漆之材，车甲之奉，日费千金，然后十万之师举矣

- 夫兵久而国利者，未之有也

- 故不尽知用兵之害者，则不能尽知用兵之利也

- 取用于国，因粮于敌

- 杀敌者，怒也；取敌之利者，货也

- 兵贵胜，不贵久

- 凡用兵之法，全国为上，破国次之；全军为上，破军次之；全旅为上，破旅次之；全卒为上，破卒次之；全伍为上，破伍次之

- 是故百战百胜，非善之善者也；不战而屈人之兵，善之善者也

- 上兵伐谋，其次伐交，其次伐兵，其下攻城

- 用兵之法，十则围之，五则攻之，倍则分之，敌则能战之，少则能逃之，不若则能避之

- 小敌之坚，大敌之擒也

- 知胜者有五：知可以战与不可以战者胜，识众寡之用者胜，上下同欲者胜，以虞待不虞者胜，将能而君不御者胜

- 知己知彼，百战不殆；不知彼而知己，一胜一负；不知彼不知己，每战必败

- 昔之善战者，先为不可胜，以待敌之可胜。不可胜在己，可胜在敌。故善战者，能为不可胜，不能使敌之可胜。故曰：胜可知，而不可为

- 善守者藏于九地之下，善攻者动于九天之上

- 见胜不过众人之知，非善之善者也；战胜而天下曰善，非善之善者也

- 举秋毫不为多力，见日月不为明目，闻雷霆不为聪耳

- 善战者之胜也，无智名，无勇功，故其战胜不忒

- 胜兵先胜而后求战，败兵先战而后求胜

- 胜兵若以镒称铢，败兵若以铢称镒

- 凡战者，以正合，以奇胜

- 善出奇者，无穷如天地，不竭如江河

- 激水之疾，至于漂石者，势也；鸷鸟之疾，至于毁折者，节也

- 善战者，求之于势，不责于人，故能择人而任势

- 凡先处战地而待敌者佚，后处战地而趋战者劳

- 善战者，致人而不致于人

- 出其所不趋，趋其所不意

- 微乎微乎，至于无形；神乎神乎，至于无声

- 我欲战，敌虽高垒深沟，不得不与我战者，攻其所必救也；我不欲战，画地而守之，敌不得与我战者，乖其所之也

- 形人而我无形，则我专而敌分

- 寡者，备人者也；众者，使人备己者也

- 策之而知得失之计，作之而知动静之理，形之而知死生之地，角之而知有余不足之处

- 形兵之极，至于无形；无形，则深间不能窥，智者不能谋

- 人皆知我所以胜之形，而莫知我所以制胜之形

- 夫兵形像水，水之形，避高而趋下，兵之形，避实而击虚。

- 水因地而制流，兵因敌而制胜

- 兵无常势，水无常形。能因敌变化而取胜者，谓之神

- 五行无常胜，四时无常位，日有短长，月有死生

- 举军而争利，则不及；委军而争利，则辎重捐

- 军无辎重则亡，无粮食则亡，无委积则亡

- 兵以诈立，以利动，以分合为变者也

- 其疾如风，其徐如林，侵略如火，不动如山，难知如阴，动如雷霆

- （李靖）赏罚必重而不欺，刑戮必严而不舍

- （太公）疾雷不及掩耳，迅电不及瞬目

- 人既专一，则勇者不得独进，怯者不得独退，此用众之法也

- 三军可夺气，将军可夺心

- 以治待乱，以静待哗。避其锐气，击其惰归

- （《军政》）见可而进，知难而退。强而避之

- 故用兵之法：高陵勿向，背丘勿逆，佯北勿从，锐卒勿攻，饵兵勿食，归师勿遏，围师必阙，穷寇勿迫

- （《三略》）香饵之下，必有悬鱼

- 途有所不由，军有所不击，城有所不攻，地有所不争，君命有所不受

- （张预）纵之而无所损，克之而无所利

- 无所不备，则无所不寡

- 是故智者之虑，必杂于利害。杂于利，而务可信也；杂于害，而患可解也

- （曹操）在利思害，在害思利

- （《吴略》）君子当安平之世，刀剑不离身

- 故用兵之法，无恃其不来，恃吾有以待之；无恃其不攻，恃吾有所不可攻也

- （赵本学）虽经年积月之后，无异于始集之时；虽暴雨严霜之夜，无间于风高马嘶之辰。一心周流乎万里之外，监戒不离于几席之前

- 将有五危：必死，可杀也；必生，可虏也；忿速，可侮也；廉洁，可辱也；爱民，可烦也。覆军杀将，必以五危

- （黄石公）勇者好行其志，愚者不顾其死
